    "<p>In this code chunk, I defined the constraints for the optimization problem. These constraints make sure the solution follows real-world limits like capacity and demand. The first constraint is the hub capacity constraint, which ensures that the total cargo shipped out from each hub does not exceed its monthly capacity. For example, the Cincinnati hub cannot ship more than 95,650 tons per month to focus cities and fulfillment centers combined. The second constraint is the focus city capacity constraint, which ensures that the total cargo entering each focus city stays within its handling capacity. For example, the focus city Leipzig can receive up to 85,000 tons from all hubs each month. The third constraint is the flow balance at focus cities, which ensures that all cargo received by a focus city is sent to fulfillment centers without any surplus or shortage. For example, if the focus city Leipzig receives 50,000 tons, it must send exactly 50,000 tons to the fulfillment centers. The fourth constraint is the fulfillment center demand constraint, which ensures each fulfillment center receives exactly the amount of cargo it needs. For example, the Paris fulfillment center must receive 6,500 tons per month, either directly from hubs or through focus cities.</p>"

The first constraint is the hub capacity constraint, which ensures that the total cargo shipped out from each hub does not exceed its monthly capacity. For example, the Cincinnati hub cannot ship more than 95,650 tons per month to focus cities and fulfillment centers combined. The second constraint is the focus city capacity constraint, which ensures that the total cargo entering each focus city stays within its handling capacity. For example, the focus city Leipzig can receive up to 85,000 tons from all hubs each month. The third constraint is the flow balance at focus cities, which ensures that all cargo received by a focus city is sent to fulfillment centers without any surplus or shortage. For example, if the focus city Leipzig receives 50,000 tons, it must send exactly 50,000 tons to the fulfillment centers. The fourth constraint is the fulfillment center demand constraint, which ensures each fulfillment center receives exactly the amount of cargo it needs.
