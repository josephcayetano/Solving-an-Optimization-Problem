# Solving an Optimization Problem
### Overview
This project solves a multi-echelon supply chain optimization problem for a logistics network. Using linear programming, the goal was to minimize total transportation costs while meeting fulfillment center demand and adhering to capacity constraints at hubs and focus cities.

### Optimization - Amazon Air case study
- Built a linear programming model (Python, PuLP) with decision variables for multi-leg shipping routes; minimized total cost to ~$199,476 while satisfying all constraints.
- Defined and enforced constraints for hub capacity, focus city capacity, flow balance, and fulfillment center demand to ensure realistic logistics planning.
- Validated the solution by analyzing the solverâ€™s output (optimal status) and confirming that all capacity and demand requirements were met, with active routes and shipment amounts detailed.
