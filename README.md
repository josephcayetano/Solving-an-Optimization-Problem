# Solving an Optimization Problem
### Overview
This project solved a supply chain problem for a logistics network using linear programming. The goal was to reduce transportation costs while meeting demand and staying within capacity limits at hubs and cities.

### Optimization - Amazon Air case study
- Built a linear programming model in Python (using PuLP) to plan multi-leg shipping routes and cut costs to about $199,476
- Set up constraints for hub and city capacity, flow balance, and demand at fulfillment centers
- Verified the solution by checking the solverâ€™s output and confirming that all requirements were met, with clear routes and shipment amounts shown
